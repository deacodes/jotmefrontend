     <textarea name="entrytext" id="entrytext">It’s strange. I slept 9 hours last night, but I still woke up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all. My head was foggy, like there was static in my brain. I didn’t want to get up, but I forced myself to because I knew if I stayed in bed, I’d start spiraling.

      I tried to go through the motions — brushed my teeth, made coffee, even opened my laptop and stared at my to-do list. It felt like looking at a wall of expectations I had no energy to climb.
      
      I haven’t really talked to anyone today. I ignored a couple of texts, not because I was upset with anyone, but because I didn’t know how to be social when I didn’t feel like a person. Is that weird?
      
      I feel like I’m running on autopilot lately. Like I’m doing all the right things on the outside, but inside, I feel numb. Not sad exactly, just… flat. It’s hard to explain. I’ve been reading articles about burnout and emotional exhaustion, and honestly, it feels a little too accurate.
      
      The worst part is, nothing “bad” is happening. I’m not in a crisis. I’m not fighting with anyone. No drama, no disasters — just this dull, heavy weight that won’t go away. It makes me feel guilty, like I don’t have the right to feel this way when other people are going through worse.
      
      But even with all that… I know this won’t last forever. There’s still a tiny part of me that wants to get better, that’s holding on. I saw a tree today — yeah, super random — but it had this one bright yellow leaf on it, and for some reason it made me smile. Just for a second.
      
      I guess that’s something, right? One second is still something. I’ll take that.</textarea>
